Implementing different modifications and algorithms for Visual Odometry and Comparing them 

###
Stereo Visual Odometry

Implemented modifications and variants to a normal stereo odometry algorithm. Used an implementation by NafBZ - https://github.com/NafBZ/Stereo-Visual-Odometry as the initial algorithm and main template around which modifications are made
